# PicoRV32 Final Project

Read **PicoRV32_Intro_GCD.pdf** for introduction for PicoRV32 and instructions to implement a GCD coprocessor for it.

Read **PicoRV32_Intro_KNN.pdf** for instructions to implement a KNN coprocessor. You'll learn to use the memory interface we provided.

The files in **PicoRV32_KNN/** is modified by me from the original [github](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32) of PicoRV32.
